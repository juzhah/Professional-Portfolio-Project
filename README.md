# Professional Porfolio Project With Sanity

>This project was bootstrapped with Vite

## Project Description
---
### **App Functionality**
This is intended to be a portfolio project with the special functionality of allowing the administrator to easily manage the content of the website by using Sanity as its CMS backend.


This project dives into multiple aspects of frontent development such as file structure in a React app, High Order Components (HOC), API calls with useEffect and components state management with useEffect.

### **Technologies used**
* React
  * React useState, useEffect, props, function components, and HOC
* Sass
* Sanity
  * Sanity Datasets, Schemas, and API

## Personal Notes

### **Motivation**
Every day I learn new things I get to feel even more motivated to start applying for tech jobs and finding this resource is just what I needed to help me know what a good portfolio project looks like and the technical complexities it requires.

### **What I learned**
* Working with HOC to enhance the UI of my web apps
* Implentening sanity to an already existing project and managing the content of the app with it

### **Challenges faced**
The main problem I encountered was that my app wasn't receiving data from the API calls; an empty array was everything I was getting returned from the backend.
I fixed this by deleting all the backend files and writing everything from scratch. The problem ended up being a project credential issue with sanity.

### **Future Goals**
* Build my own portofolio
* Create future good looking frontend projects powered by Sanity
* Learn a new programming concept || framework || language || tool

## How to Install
